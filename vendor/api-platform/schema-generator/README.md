# API Platform Schema Generator

`schema` is a command line tool part of [the API Platform framework](https://api-platform.com) that instantly generates a set
of PHP classes from vocabularies such as (but not limited to) [Schema.org](https://schema.org)
or [ActivityStreams](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/) or from an [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) documentation.

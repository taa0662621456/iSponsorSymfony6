**A browser testing and web scraping library for [PHP](https://php.net) and [Symfony](https://symfony.com)**

![CI](https://github.com/symfony/panther/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

*Panther* is a convenient standalone library to scrape websites and to run end-to-end tests **using real browsers**.

Panther is super powerful. It leverages [the W3C's WebDriver protocol](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/) to drive native web browsers such as Google Chrome and Firefox.

Panther is built on top of [PHP WebDriver](https://github.com/php-webdriver/php-webdriver) and [several other FOSS libraries](https://symfony.com/blog/introducing-symfony-panther-a-browser-testing-and-web-scrapping-library-for-php#thank-you-open-source).
It has been inspired by [Nightwatch.js](http://nightwatchjs.org/), a WebDriver-based testing tool for JavaScript.

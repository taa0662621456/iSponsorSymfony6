This is my study project. It helps me gain practical skills and experience in PHP web development.
I Also use the latest version of Symfony so that always know about the latest updates.
Code in this repository is not required to work, has many bugs, anti-patterns, is not SOLID, and is not covered by tests...
I'm working on making the code better.
